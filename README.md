# Privacy-Preserving Document Verification using Zero-Knowledge Proofs

A research project that enables users to prove specific facts about their documents without revealing the document itself.

## Project Overview

Traditional document verification requires users to share complete documents, exposing sensitive personal information such as names, dates of birth, addresses, identification numbers, and academic records.

This project uses **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** to allow users to prove selected claims about a document while keeping the original document private.

The system combines:

- OCR-based document processing
- Attribute extraction
- Circom circuits
- Groth16 proof generation
- Cryptographic proof verification

to achieve privacy-preserving document verification.

---

## Problem Statement

In conventional verification systems:

- Complete documents must be shared
- Sensitive information is exposed unnecessarily
- Verifiers gain access to data unrelated to the requested verification

For example:

To prove:

- Age ≥ 18

A user typically shares an entire identity document, revealing:

- Full name
- Date of birth
- Address
- Document number

This violates the principle of minimum disclosure.

---

## Proposed Solution

The proposed system allows users to:

1. Upload a document
2. Select verification claims
3. Generate a Zero-Knowledge Proof
4. Download proof files
5. Share only the proof files with a verifier

The verifier can then:

1. Upload the proof files
2. Verify the proof cryptographically
3. Confirm the claim is true

without accessing the original document.

## Key Features

### Privacy-Preserving Verification

Verify document attributes without revealing the document itself.

### OCR-Based Processing

Automatically extracts information from:

- PDF documents
- Image documents

### Supported Claims

#### Aadhaar Documents

- Name Verification
- Age ≥ 18 Verification
- Gender Verification
- Multi-Attribute Verification

#### Academic Documents

- Student Name Verification
- Result Verification
- Grade Verification
- Grand Total Verification

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation

Generates:

- proof.json
- public.json
- verification_key.json

### Independent Verification

Verifiers can independently verify proofs without accessing original documents.

### Multi-Attribute Verification

Supports verification of multiple claims using a single proof.

## Usage

### Generate Proof

1. Open Generate Proof page
2. Upload a supported document
3. Review OCR results
4. Select verification claims
5. Click Generate Proof
6. Download:

```text
proof.json
public.json
verification_key.json
```

---

### Verify Proof

1. Open Verify Proof page
2. Upload:

```text
proof.json
public.json
verification_key.json
```

3. Click Verify Proof
4. View verification result

Example:

```text
✓ VALID PROOF

This proof is cryptographically valid.
```

or

```text
✗ INVALID PROOF

This proof failed cryptographic verification.
```

---

## Security and Privacy

The system is designed around the principle of **Selective Disclosure**.

### Private Information

Never shared with the verifier:

- Original document
- Raw OCR text
- Personal details
- Sensitive attributes

### Shared Information

Only:

- Zero-Knowledge Proof
- Public Signals
- Verification Key

This allows verification without revealing document contents.

The implementation integrates:

- OCR
- Attribute Extraction
- Circom Circuits
- Groth16 Proving
- Cryptographic Verification

into a complete end-to-end verification workflow.
